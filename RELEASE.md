# quicknotes.nvim v1.0.0 Release Notes

This is the first official release of `quicknotes.nvim`!

`quicknotes.nvim` is a tiny, zero-friction floating quick notes panel for
Neovim. It's designed for those moments when you need to jot down a thought
without switching windows, changing buffers, or losing focus.

## ✨ Features

* **Floating Note Panel:** Opens your notes in a clean, centered floating window.
* **Automatic Organization:** Automatically creates a new section for each day's
notes, keeping your thoughts organized by date.
* **Auto-saving:** Your notes are saved automatically when you close the panel.
* **Simple Keybindings:** Close the notes panel with `q` or `<Esc>`, just like
a help buffer.
* **Easy to Use:** Works out of the box with a simple setup process.
* **Customizable:** You can configure the directory where your notes are stored.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, install `quicknotes.nvim` using your favorite plugin manager and
add the setup call to your `init.lua`. See the [README.md](README.md) for
installation instructions.

We hope you enjoy using `quicknotes.nvim`! Please feel free to open an issue or
pull request on GitHub if you have any feedback or suggestions.
